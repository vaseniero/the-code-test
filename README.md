Code Test using .Net Core 2.2

*The Code Test*

Please write a .Net Core 2.2 application that downloads this file https://ringba-test-html.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/TestQuestions/output.txt and then prints out some statistics about the file.

The file is using a very simple form of compression in which there are no spaces, each word is separated by camel casing. For Example, the string "TheCatWillRun" is parsed as "The Cat Will Run".

*Now for the statistics*

Please print to the console the following statistics about the content in the file retrieved above.

- How many of each letter are in the file
- How many letters are capitalized in the file
- The most common word and the number of times it has been seen.
- The most common 2 character prefix and the number of occurrences in the text file.

Note that the word "in" does not contain the prefix "in" but the word "indirectly" does.

We will be judging you on the completeness of the assignment, the readability of the code and the efficiency of your solution.

Please submit your completed code test, your salary requirement, and a copy of your resume to this job posting.

Download the .Net Core 2.2 runtime and create a directory ringba-test. Navigate to that directory and run "dotnet new console"
